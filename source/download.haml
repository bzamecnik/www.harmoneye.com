  How to capture sound going to headphones/speakers?

      What HarmonEye listens to is the default sound device set in the system `Preferences` -> `Sound` -> `Input`. On a standard Mac it is the microphone or the line input.

      In case you have an external sound card it could be some of its inputs.
  .span4

      But. The fun begins when you can use _any_ audio input including YouTube music videos, iTunes, GarageBand or anything else.

      In order words when you route the default system output to the default system input. Mac OS X itself cannot do this, but with a some help it _is_ possible.

    :markdown
      What we need is the **<a href="http://cycling74.com/products/soundflower/">Soundflower</a>** application. It consists of a driver that extends the OS kernel and a GUI application to configure how the sound devices should be routed.

      It is freely available from the creators of the famous Max audio application. Soundflower works nicely on Mountain Lion and some older Mac OS X versions.

%h3 Why the application is not yet signed or on App Store?
%p You don't need to be worried. HarmonEye doesn't contain anything bad inside. In fact, it has been certified by SoftPedia as clean from any malware. I'm just not planning to make a Developer Account for desktop applications.

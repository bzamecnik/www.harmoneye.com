          HarmonEye is a unique software **application** that listens to the **music**, applies some deep math under the hood and shows you the **tones** and **chords** being played.
          
          It is able to process **any audio** on your computer. It works in **real-time** so that you don't have to wait.
      .span4
        :markdown
          The **intensity** of each **tone** in an octave is shown as a segment of a **circle** (like on the clock). A loud tone makes a long red segment. Multiple tones make a **chord**.
          
          As the music plays the circle is animated.
          
          In fact, it looks like a retina of an **eye**!
      .span4
        :markdown
          From that you can easily see the **melody**, **chords** and the **key** of your favourite songs. Including the nuances like a singer’s vibrato. You can learn singing or playing guitar, piano or other instruments more effectively.
          
          You can **write** it down. Or just **look** at it for hours and be **amazed** like me!

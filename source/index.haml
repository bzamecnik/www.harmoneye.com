          HarmonEye is a unique software **application** that listens to the **music**, applies some deep math under the hood and shows you the **tones** and **chords** being played.
          
          It is able to process **any audio** on your computer. It works in **real-time** so that you don't have to wait.
      .span4
        :markdown
          The **intensity** of each **tone** in an octave is shown as a segment of a **circle** (like on the clock). A loud tone makes a long red segment. Multiple tones make a **chord**.
          
          As the music plays the circle is animated.
          
          In fact, it looks like a retina of an **eye**!
      .span4
        :markdown
          From that you can easily see the **melody**, **chords** and the **key** of your favourite songs. Including the nuances like a singer’s vibrato.
          
          You can **write** it down. Or just **look** at it for hours and be **amazed** like me!

          For a few bucks that you might spend on a single party night it will allow you to use HarmonEye until the end of days.
          
          Note that HarmonEye is presently available **only** for **Mac OS X** desktop.

        %p Why HarmonEye is not free, open-source, for mobiles or other platforms? I'd love it to be so, too! It just takes some time and work.
      .span4
        %p Well, there is just a single person spending nights on crafting this thing, who needs something to eat and somewhere to sleep.
          
        %p Every buck earned goes directly to making HarmonEye better!

        -#%p Would you like the software and cannot afford it? Well, I'm not mean. Instead of money you can spend just a bit of time and effort and consequently <a href="/buy/#free-license">get a license for free</a>.
          
        %p Would you like to support the development of HarmonEye in another way? God bless you! You can. Eg. tell your friends, make a video, write a review. Thanks!
